Developing a computational framework to analyze the impact of SNPs on proteins associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This project integrates graph algorithms and machine learning to explore SNP-protein interactions, identify key genetic markers, and provide insights into T2DM pathways for potential therapeuticÂ applications.
